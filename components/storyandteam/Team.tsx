I specialise in breaking down complex problems into clear, step-by-step methods â€” an approach that has helped many students achieve distinctions and gain confidence. Along the way, Iâ€™ve also built a strong following as one of Singaporeâ€™s rising Math influencer-tutors, where thousands of parents and students learn from my videos. Today, I lead and train our team of tutors at Maythematics to ensure every lesson is taught with the same clarity, consistency, and care.",

Today, I teach Primary Math as well as Secondary 1â€“5 Emath and Amath, focusing on making concepts simple, structured, and approachable.
